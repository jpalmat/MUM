0) Download and build the following framework in your local eclipse/STS

https://github.com/psalek/common-base-module

1) Start by using your Spring Data JPA Example from yesterday

2) Replace Spring Boot dependency with the following dependency:

    <parent>
        <groupId>edu.miu.common</groupId>
        <artifactId>common-base-module</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
    </parent>

3) Change the list of dependencies in your POM file to:

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>edu.miu.common</groupId>
            <artifactId>common-base-service</artifactId>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

4) Start building your project by extending the following super types:

BaseRepository

BaseReadService

BaseReadServiceImpl

BaseController

5) Remember that you need to add a response type which basically in the simplest form is a copy of your entity with all the JPA annotaions removed from it. Also , remember to "implement Serializable" in your response class.

6) Write a mapper of type <Entity, EntityResponse> by extending from BaseMapper

7) Add the following Component Scan to your project:

@ComponentScan(basePackages = "edu.miu.common, edu.miu.cs.cs544")
