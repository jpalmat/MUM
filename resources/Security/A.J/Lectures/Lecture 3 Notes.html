<pre><h3>Lecture 3 Security Policies in general, Bell-LaPadula model</h3>
This lecture covers Chapters 4, 5

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
1. A security policy defines what is secure

2. A security mechanism implements a security policy

3. For research purposes think of two different types of security policies: those
dealing with confidentiality and those dealing with integrity.

4. However, real world security policies deal with confidentiality, integrity and availability

5. The Bell-LaPadula model is a confidentiality policy. Subject and objects are assigned
security levels. A security level includes a security clearance (top secret, secret, etc.) and
some categories (e.g., EUR, NUC, GER) indicating need to know within the security clearance.

6. Security clearances are mandatory access controls. Bell-LaPadula also allows for 
discretionary access controls like we looked at in the previous lecture, but these are
checked only after the security clearances are checked.

6. A "lower" security level cannot read from a "higher" security level. (no read up)

7. A "higher" security level cannot write to a "lower" security level (no write down)

<h3>Chapter 4 Security Policies</h3>
A good overview of what has be be considered when creating a security policy is at
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2196.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2196.html</a>

Definition 4-1 A <i>security policy</i> is a statement that partitions the states of the
system into a set of <i>authorized</i>, or <i>secure</i> states and a set of
<i>unauthorized</i>, or <i>non-secure</i> states.

Definition 4-2 A <i>secure</i> system is a system that starts in an authorized state and
cannot enter an unauthorized state.

Definition 4-3 A <i>breach of security</i> occurs when a system enters an unauthorized state.

Definition 4-4 Let X be a set of entities and let I be some information. Then I has the
property of <i>confidentiality</i> with respect to X if no member of X can obtain information
about I.

Definition 4-5 Let X be a set of entities and let I be some information. Then I has the
property of <i>integrity</i> with respect to X if all members of X trust I.

If I is data, this is data integrity
If I is the origin of something, this is origin integrity (or authentication)
If I is a resource, then this is assurance that the resource operates according to its spec.

Definition 4-6 Let X be a set of entities and let I be a resource. Then I has the property
of <i>availability</i> with respect to X if all members of X can access I.

"access" is relative (1 hour delay okay for amazon, not okay for medical data)

Definition 4-7 A <i>security mechanism</i> is an entity or procedure that enforces some part
of the security policy.

Distinction between security policy and security mechanism is important

Example: Student A copies a file of student B because B did not read protect it. The 
security policy forbids copying so A has violated the policy. Had B used the mechanism of
setting the file permission then student A could not have copied. However, B is not in
violation of the security policy.

Example - Security policy must specify procedures to handle backups of confidential data.

<h4>Types of Security Policies</h4>

Definition 4-9 A <i>military security policy</i> (also called a <i>governmental security policy</i>
is a security policy developed primarily to provide confidentiality.

Integrity and availability are also important, but confidentiality is the most important for
the military.

Confidentiality is a major part of <i>privacy</i>, but privacy also restricts what information 
the government can ask of an individual.

The following distinction between confidentiality and privacy is from <a href="http://www.library.cmu.edu/ethics2.html">http://www.library.cmu.edu/ethics2.html</a>
<div style="color:red">
Privacy "denotes a zone of inaccessibility" of mind or body, the right to be left alone and 
to maintain individual autonomy, solitude, intimacy, and <span class="red">control over information about oneself.</span> 

Confidentiality "concerns the communication of <span class="red">private</span> and personal information from one person
to another." The key ingredients of confidentiality are trust and loyalty. Professionals rely 
on the promise of confidentiality to inspire trust in their clients and patients. In the case 
of lawyers, psychiatrists, and clergy, communications are legally designated "privileged."
</div>

Definition 4-10 A <i>commercial security policy</i> is a security policy developed primarily
to provide integrity.

Example: Banks can't afford to have accounts altered incorrectly.

Transactions (as in database transactions) are important to many integrity policies.

Note that trust plays a major role here, i.e., the concern here is about the accuracy of
an object. This contrasts with a confidentiality policy whose focus is restricting access to 
an object; it "officially" doesn't care whether the object is accurate or not.

However, commercial organizations are also interested in confidentiality, e.g., they would
like to control who looks at:
  personnel data
  marketing plans
  formulas
  manufacturing and development techniques

Definition 4-11 A <i>confidentiality policy</i> is a security policy dealing only with
confidentiality

Definition 4-12 An <i>integrity policy</i> is a security policy dealing only with integrity.

<h4>The Role of Trust</h4>
The role of trust is crucial to understanding the nature of computer security. Any theory or
mechanism rests on certain assumptions. The accuracy of those assumptions affects the trust
we have in the system.

Example: Assumptions in effect when applying a security patch (e.g. an update to Windows)
1. Assume patch originated from Microsoft and that it wasn't modified in transit.

2. Assume that Microsoft tested the patch thoroughly.

3. Assume that Microsoft's test environment corresponds to the environment to which the
patch was applied. (e.g., same previous patches are in effect) 

4. Assume that patch is installed correctly.

Example: What assumptions in effect for a formally verified program S?
1. The formal verification of S is correct.

2. The assumptions made in the formal verification of S are correct.

3. S is compiled correctly

4. Hardware that runs compiled version of S is functioning correctly.

<h4>Types of Access Control</h4>

Definition 4-13 If an individual user can set an access control mechanism to allow or deny
access to an object, that mechanism is a <i>discretionary access control</i>(DAC), also called
an <i>identity-based access control</i> (IBAC).

Example: Access control in Windows is discretionary.

Definition 4-14 When a system mechanism controls access to an object and an individual user
cannot alter that access, the control is a <i>mandatory access control</i> (MAC),
occasionally called a <i>rule-based access control</i>.

Example: The military might use an OS that sets the access rights of a document based on
the security clearance of the person who created the object. The person who created the 
document cannot change the access rights.

Example: The law allows a court to access driving records <i>without the owner's permission.</i>

Definition 4-15 An originator controlled access control (ORCON or ORGCON) bases access on the
creator of the object (or the information it contains).

Example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">Digital Rights Management</a>

Example: Contractor signs a NDA (non-disclosure agreement) which requires him to get permission
before giving certain information to somebody else.

See the <a href="http://www.etext.org/CuD/Papers/company-email">Electronic Mail Association's</a> white paper
for things to consider when creating a email policy.	 

We will now look at an example of a confidentiality policy (Bell-LaPadula) and an 
integrity policy (Biba)

<h4>Goals of Confidentiality Policies</h4>
A confidentiality policy, also called an <i>information flow policy</i>, prevents the
unauthorized disclosure of information. It is not concerned with the integrity or 
availability of the information.

Military: Enemy must not know battle plans.

Government: The U.S. Privacy Act requires that certain personal data, e.g., income tax returns, 
be kept confidential.

<h4> The Bell-LaPadula Model</h4>
Corresponds to military style classifications. It has influenced much of the development
of computer security technologies.

<h4>Informal Description</h4>
The simplest type of confidentiality classification is a set of <i>security clearances</i>
arranged in a linear (total) ordering.

A total ordering is defined as follows:

For all a, b and c in a set X (in this case the set of security clearances/classifications):

if a R b and b R a then a = b (antisymmetry) 
if a R b and b R c then a R c (transitivity) 
a R b or b R a (totality or completeness) 

Let X = {top secret, secret, confidential, unclassified}
Let R =
{
 {unclassified, top secret},
 {unclassified, secret},
 {unclassified, confidential},
 {confidential, top secret},
 {confidential, secret},
 {secret, top secret} 
}
Then R defines a total ordering on X
Read a R b as a has a lower security clearance than b.

A subject has a security clearance
An object has a security classification

The goal of the Bell-LaPadula model is to prevent read access to objects at a 
security classification higher than the subject's clearance.

<table border="1">
	<tbody><tr><td>Clearance/Classification</td><td>Subject(s)</td><td>Object(s)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>TOP SECRET(TS)</td><td>Tamara, Thomas</td><td>Personnel Files</td></tr>
	<tr><td>SECRET(S)</td><td>Sally, Samuel  </td><td>Electronic Mail Files</td></tr>
	<tr><td>CONFIDENTIAL(C)</td><td>Claire, Clarence</td><td>Activity Log Files</td></tr>
	<tr><td>UNCLASSIFIED(UC)</td><td>Utaley, Thomas</td><td>Telephone List Files</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

So Clarence cannot read Electronic Mail or Personnel files.

The Bell-LaPadula security model combines mandatory and discretionary access controls. The
mandatory controls dominate; the discretionary controls in the access control matrix are
applied only if the mandatory controls indicate that the subject can access the object.

Let L(S) = l<sub>s</sub> be the security clearance of subject S
Let L(O) = l<sub>o</sub> be the security classification of object O

<b>Simple Security Condition, Preliminary Version</b>
S can read O if and only if l<sub>o</sub> &lt;= l<sub>s</sub> 
and S has discretionary read access to O.

But need to prevent somebody from copying a high security file into a lower security file.

<b>*-Property, Preliminary Version</b>
S can write O if and only if l<sub>s</sub> &lt;= l<sub>o</sub> 
and S has discretionary write access to O.

This means that somebody with a UNCLASSIFIED clearance can write to a TOP SECRET file
assuming the have write access to the file.

Theorem 5-1 Basic Security Theorem(summarized). If a system starts out secure and each
state transition respects the two above conditions, then the system is secure.

Expand the model by adding categories to each security clearance/classification.
Each category describes a kind of information. This models "need to know". A subject can
only read/write objects in categories associated with the subject.

Each security clearance/classification and category form a <i>security level</i>.

Example
If Clarence has a security clearance of (CONFIDENTIAL, {EUR, US}) then he can read CONFIDENTIAL documents about
EUR (Europe) or US (U.S.). See below for other documents that he has access to.

Definition 5-1 The security level (L, C) <i>dominates</i> the security level (L', C')
if and only if L' &lt;= L and C' subset of C

Example, if
George is cleared into security level (SECRET, {NUC, EUR})
DocA is classified as (CONFIDENTIAL, {NUC})
DocB is classified as (SECRET, {EUR, US})
DocC is classified as (SECRET, {EUR})

then
George <i>dom</i> DocA
George !<i>dom</i> DocB (George doesn't have need to know about US information)
George <i>dom</i> DocC

Now use categories to improve on the preliminary security conditions given above.
<b>Simple Security Condition</b>
S can read O if and only if S <i>dom</i> O and S has discretionary read access to O.

<b>*-Property</b>
S can write to O if and only if O dom S and S has discretionary write access to O.

So if S is cleared into (UNCLASSIFIED, {}), S can write to a (TOP SECRET, {NUC}) file
(assuming that S has write access to the file).

Theorem 5-2 Basic Security Theorem(summarized). If a system starts out secure and each
state transition respects the two above conditions, then the system is secure.

A subject S has a <i>maximum security level</i> and a <i>current security level</i>. The
maximum security level must dominate the current security level. S may effectively 
decrease its security level from the maximum in order to communicate with subjects at
lower security levels.

Bell-LaPadula is an abstract model and can be adapted to various environments

"read" conventionally means "allowing information to flow from the object being read to
the subject reading". Thus "read" usually includes "execute" because the subject could monitor
the instructions in the object.

"write" conventionally means "allowing subject writing to the object written". "write" normally
includes "appends".

[Aamir]
ACM gives you the in depth &amp; detailed view of the rights of the objects 
and subjects , SCI is a complete knowledge that gives you the complete 
insight of your potential.

Object and subject are the key fields of ACM. zRest and activity are the 
steps of progress,

The Java sandbox restricts applets from performing many activities.

An invincible nervous system, built as a result of constant meditation, 
restricts stresses from making us stressed.
