1) No deadlock in this case, because we have only one resource with two instances, one for each process.

2) 
	a) In this case we have two processes, two resources with one instance each, process 0 computes for 10 ms then asks 
for resource 0, analogous for process 1, which asks for resource 1 instead. no problems so far. 
after another 10 ms, process 0 asks for resource 1, however we have only one instance which is being used by process 1, so 
process 0 waits for process 1 to release its resource, but before it happen, process 1 also asks for resource 0 which is 
being hold by process 0, so process 1 waits as well. now we have two processes each one is waiting for an event that only 
the other process can cause. which represent a deadlock situation.
	
	b) By adding another instance to resource 1, no deadlock arise, because when process 0 asks for resource 1, the OS grants the request immediately, at the same time, process 1 waits for process 0 to complete and release resource 0. When process 0 finishes its work, it releases the resources which allow process 1 to gain access to resource 0 and continue working till it finishes.
