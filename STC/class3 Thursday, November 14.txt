Couple of related topics in your Academic Program those are what's George what's the importance or the relationship lava different things that you're studying gator signs of course so there's computer science and there's also computer science is related to mathematics works also you're studying this discourse right weather in why are there actually has over the years one was SEI marshy science of creative intelligence there's a c i s t c another name is maharshi is Vedic science you've been sort of different names that we present similar and what they have in common well it is going to be released from one angle that what they have in common is this and the study of consciousness haven't always been that make my move this morning study of consciousness in the past it was perhaps considered a philosophy or you would read some book about Play-Doh talk about the absolute truth or dares Hollister store Las Vegas phone because science was a science of physics is probably the best example of what we bleeding at modern science physics is the science of things right that's what physical means tierra restaurant business real there are certain criteria for it is science for people like to think that what they're doing is science well I'm a household scientist and I mean that they clean the house where I'm at garbage man meaning of structural knowledge to go there today in approval result not even in our area we talk about software engineering and there's a lot of discussion of is it true are we really engineering feeling your hair means that you can design something means that it comes from science and results and in fact to be an engineer exam you license if you build a building building in Downtown Chicago or New York there's more you can go out the insurance because you are laughing so there are principles and there are laws in the world if this is a little bit of how we feel softer are you willing to guarantee that for three thousand or million dollars there are no longer correct software building a car with airplane problems that the software might have and I know that nobody knows this man a little bit saying we wish we knew how to do it like that do we know not does not ellenwood the question is are there laws is there any Saudis are indeed a science sasd science technology here to describe a little bit why we feel Justified and what did Ivan is is that in fact is true and indeed has the basis of it if you look at the signs besides this bases of dating have laws and so on I'm having a model and evidence and a model comes from having a paradigm paradigm's does not mean two dimes computer science we have turn on Bluetooth is the most common one that's the one that's hatred and most of all we do that's not the only one I couldn't hear size structured programming well I can that can be used in multiple ways of doing it a subset was called imperative programming games like mCC tropical Plus and it's interesting that that this view is part of the where model dude I don't think I went soft memory is what happens or combat 435i Franca functional programming is quite different another one up way of thinking is that it problems with problem solving in a different way than you would in remind me to post called constraint programming and parallel programming and you know.... These would have a different way of solving things each one of them there's a mom you build a model different depending on computer science engineering more money means more happiness then you have I'm the Pokemon I'm always says that good health it's important to think about the Paradigm really asks what is structure of the world outdoor World Birds so in some sense of Paradigm is very important because it determines our action we're going to do depends on what we know so that's importance not just a theoretical thing back to the the starting point here of all these things how do they interact and how does this affect what is our paradigm and another thing that I like we could add to this is that our University is called maharshi city of management and so what this has in common with all of these how to be a science the song and this and you maharshi has Theirs to its Maha and then Rishi 2 in his culture in India in the language a literal translation what is someone who has refined their Consciousness enough no laws of nature structure I didn't hear it from someone whatever that Tuesday a scientist biology or mathematics in architecture looks in the building where is Wally's baby cousin play no no is this way this way to prevent leg weight for beauty at this way for us to building all this visuals talk about that I needed that any system mathematics natural law maha means that idea and maharshi and I'm from that he created at University and that's where we are now it's a little bit about this Confluence of these three areas of these areas and the best way to do what I think is to as I said before we need to have a model a mild handle I will give a short sort of idea or an overview of how that might work journal Times this morning give a description that that maharshi has described in fact that you can start with something called K not okay. Would be if you have a certain amount of time jerry Mathers School about time you should be able to the main idea of how something work elevator speech anyone know yeah I'm very good ideas the time that Enoch that one minute so you have some great idea for a new business or product employees that plays elevator you have to be in there with Bill Gates or whatever the current president is I don't know great idea or is it can you not mean that you should be able to capture the main idea so this would be K1 I'm or we could call the final result Kay Starr when you know everything about Samaria we should work this way you're going to study for maybe one year volume 6 weeks or 6 months well the programming is not the same as computer science the greater knowledge, vir Mar Street Experience morning be the king off elevator speech version across the street so this is it we'll have to sort of an introduction to a here so this is RK not version of it after you get the main idea of what is it relate to your other study and what I think a simple model we can use this one because we're familiar with it so when we learn TM have this model right so you know idea of a bubble diagram basketball games this model what is this model use right when we learn TM we talk about it what's the outward level of this the upper levels of this what does that indicate some process this inner level so to describe these things colton would be a model of sort of Consciousness we talked about about doing our TM practice and going Within the difference between the inner levels of this this is more concrete right yes yes yes in what other adjectives could be used to contrast these beginner and is out of water I'm eating after I put off when we will want to meditate with her.20 more of what I think I heard that I'll pretend I did more silence and then by contrast this would be more what active okay an activity this is more objective this is things on the outside of this would be more what we could we could go on in owning and give the different these are to really really I didn't mean to look at this and that and I studied my family thanks these are all this is toward the idea of things this is more toward the idea of self and then what we call this little. At the bottom of it what is this feel that we're beginning to experience as a field of Consciousness right that's how we describe this and this would be we can talk about this is being pure consciousness yeah it means no nothing thinking about this I'm not. I'm not asleep I'm not nothing I'm spell myself right consciousness aware of itself so it has this quality of I don't know if you've used this so much your car spit of self-referral there's a model of TM transcending list of finish for a second you know that with continued practice what happens instead of our experience being this our experience becomes this prince becomes this so that instead of saying that we experience that's what idea of 200% because there's certainly a lot out here in the whole world find out and we learn is there's a lot here too so one or the other randy wearing today I'm sorry I really want to be a computer person have a big career between us so I don't have time for myself I'm going to have to become traitors I have to say I just wanted to help myself I don't have time for life of course our clothes. Yes. I did two hundred percent we will just buy incrementally training online levels in Phyllis I think we know also and you've seen in your courses idea of in physics in modern physics seymour model use the same diagram they have the outer level of I'll just say things I feel like that and they talk about how bradley a unified field year you don't know me by now but I don't know trying to answer the question same question how do things how do I saying it is this Consciousness was pure consciousness is there seymour dog all kinds of things in the universe at the Moore's refine level they say there are particles and there are fields and there is energy things we see physics classes had this approach I said everything we have is made from a certain number of elements right yes 100 things carbon nitrogen that those are the building blocks of children have have a fundamental building blocks you can do john we know how the universe was built is here so we're done we figured out the whole universe when did Ellen come from those are dope out something where they made of well atoms and molecules so they go okay this is made out of nothing they're made out of what subatomic particle get down to this sheldon in the since it's a shield is a field also so a field is not a thing shield is not a thing is there's electrical fields did you get your property watch TV what is life in the vibration of and what modern last round was it all of the things when we know vibrations of this field of this field vibrations anakin physics just talks about this as being a unified field define by what's an example of something that you can vibrate an example I oftentimes good as you can think of a piano a guitar and use a better example of a vitamin do people on rest events expand your horizons a little bit music I'll take one of those instruments if you play the guitar guitars have a 5-string 6 Grand Buffet are you you hit you banging right what do you hear set alarm later to verify the resonant frequency is Outback system that system calculate out what the frequencies of vibration are on the system and that says when you put energy and you're going to happen that's how we do this part is they wrote the equations for that I said vibrate that are the fundamental particles that we see verify if that's really true mathematical theory is really true equations for electron Mass Velocity energy on that you know what you think of square root what else plus or minus to write another one electron play start experiments they were unified field the principal is what the principal is excitation expectation of something creates the vibrations of it expressions you see the locket are you thinking tuning fork you know what tuning for no matter how you hit that tuning fork do you know what I'm going to buy way that we can analyze the structure of it so there are laws I hate the physics of materials will tell us how something going to vibrate so we didn't know is where we going to start really the vibration out something so that's what this that's what this is all about everything we know our own consciousness not happy when I feel sad you might feel this way and if we can experience that source of Consciousness that most refined level just like this weekend create unified field I'm just saying consciousness is studying it one way and what do we say it from I was just made meditate by building machine how do we study, without using a microscope you don't do the scale we don't use school instead of Consciousness Tuesday only copy I know itself certain people look pretty those are the things inside out reply I think about it we Know by difference between modern science science randolph you think this huge experiment on gravity and trying to detect gravity waves you want to grab some of that studying something as well as on the outside consciousness the laboratory notebook close our eyes when we experience those that are great experts in consciousness this is my meditator picture here throughout time all say the same thing when you look at five thousand years I heard this or I saw that I am I am el Universal I am the universe earlier I said then one of the kenosis and their methods and techniques for it learning now so we learned through RTM maybe some logic is a field of your condiments yes it's not grounded field yes is purely abstract is it true that you being like yes I see if history has happened the other there's really only one way to answer that question an app to do the experiment yourself the ocean is wonderful if you jump his so cool and so refreshing all that yeah I believe that but you're not going to really know it till what so all of this we do here at the University all of the daily schedule and I'll stay up late not to eat organic food that is an experiment volume levels and see if indeed it is in the direction of the model. Good morning study tomorrow that's the way to go turn on the Drone activity k04 K1 but they're their case I want to say one of their little thing about this relationship between modern science what would you call the science of Kratom telephone list of all the prophets I have started off with idea of names like I said that we had the name of s c i signs of Greater intelligence STC Science and Technology Society vedic sign be there science the idea was when we go through k-star field of knowledge that everything I described earlier maharshi another day another given that knowledge words beta eDD really means it means this area here this area lol pure consciousness comparing it to modern science modern physics so here this model from GM is what we go from Coffin and last month redmi Transcendence that would practice more familiar with those quieter areas montreal right now if we have to be yours we have stress or strain wild night new York so you let me see see more stars right way up there they were there delayed our traveling once we're up in the country in Canada we're out on some Indian Reservation look up the sky billions of stars in the Milky Way you must have some other time it wasn't that it was Australia or eyes got to become accustomed to as we continue to practice our GM more smartStyle area it's not a matter of go to Canada go to New York all windows refine our attention the TM technique is a way of doing that one way that fashion Divine I think I answered to some degree was how do things come from nonliving things do you know where they are soft weight loss like that learn something like that now so there's siri is called have you heard that theory it from bit john Wheeler and we'll go all the way not really things things are just pieces of information the whole universe is really not so much a collection of things like the children information structures start a bit and we build grass movies virtual reality 101010 eating it as structures correction of this it from qubit from Quantum bits is that quantum bit if you not your grace move to bits 0 or 1 walking Dead is different because it has both hora zero zero where they work is that particles isn't the right word that two different systems are water called in Tangled I have to do each other they affect each other distance it's a big deal moving a little bit in the same number. Quantum Computing which is the last thing I wanted to mention because we know from relativity Theory relativity the evolution of physics of Newtonian physics right Newtonian physics said the way things interact with a bump into each other velocity little Einsteins you found his General specialty relative didn't talk about things with vision in Leetonia it talked about dsld Rose Newton and then relativity Einstein talked about things like the speed of light how all these things Interactive impossible nothing happens faster than the speed of light.
A limit to the speed speed of light mechanic says something different this is like have two particles and one parent angle they represent the state of each other I can separate him out like with one on Mars one here when I change one the other one instantaneously do a related state instantaneously but one of the other end of the universe my coffee cup change that one instantaneously this one changes new paradigm right spongeBob more refined laws of nature it was impossible before not only possible we want to do it says that quantum physics qC Quantum computing wedding says what was impossible before is not only possible now but it's really important so this comes to science and Technology business well we are a long way to go before going to have very good quantum computers probably 10 to 20 years what people estimate when we do this is why you should know about it change everything will change everything the United States send 40 billion dollars off to some other country or puts it in the bank in your bank move money around all the time because interest rate stock markets are changing fluoride all the time how does that happen if somebody load up a big truck with dollar bills you known somebody sits down pipes and something at a computer couple of bits Grover Network right now when you get money in your bank account I don't want to disappoint you but there's no such thing as money money bit pattern somewhere good pattern say how much you are worth how much you can spend and you get a credit card out it has bit patterns on it and that doesn't computer to move more bit patterns into somebody else's bit patterns and people carried gold around and a dollar bill that is worth gold to go down to get the gold $2 bills worth something because the government cross their fingers promises how much we can trust governments right because people think they are moving around around what is the attack that wire turn your bank account and you change it to $1000000 austin Powers 1 million 1 billion dollars why can't you do that security what are those security measures the encryption right so this says that things are encrypted now how does encryption work we don't have time but you might know this is a mathematical functions book called trapdoor function it's very easy to compute one way and very hard to get the other way put on your American Express credit card anywhere if I get that out of the database and I get your password encrypted password is no good to me unless I can encrypt it right unencrypted an encrypted transaction answer is and no siri says yes reality says know why because it's a trapdoor function it's easy to encrypted easy to unencrypted it would take hundreds or hundreds of hundreds of years to do on the fastest computers that we have 300 years from now what your password what's right you get it have the rules changed the rules of computing change and that's what Quantum computing. Quantum computation how different if you have to solve a maze problem on a computer and you're running an algorithm on it the maze has a junction turn right or left right that's a bit 0 or 1 at the data structure may 01 with one of the data structure right that tree and find out which one of the binary tree cN different branches in it to the end bits representing solution when do we have to explore all the to the end possibilities right let's say there's a what's 2 to the 8th you guys need to take him to pee again what's 2 squared 416 + 38 + 16 square drive get it right decision what's 2 to 32 well as an MBA student would say it's a lie it's big how long does it take to calculate 3 trillion 4 trillion possibility well encryption Dibley is 128 bits whats 2 + 128 extra points if you know this one it's too much right in fact they're only about 10 to the 80th particles in the universe and which is which is at 240th plus the number of computations Richard Moore the number of atoms in the whole universe checked it over secret database of all of our credit cards all of our money on a Quantum Computing how does it work if I've got eight bits take a simple one instead of to the eight steps it takes one Step because you represent every decision by a cubit in those cubits are all coupled to each other and need to find some constraints on the outcome is and they all go together until 1:30 okay so we saved from to the 8 to 1 benefits to 2284 trillion how many steps does it take oh my gosh so much for encryption right you can have these been in science fiction movies from time machine with Quantum encoded links look at it when we talk about tapping the wire tap that wire you break the entanglement and you can tell the point is that what used to be hard or impossible now so hard impossible become easy normal and then we have these quantum computers available the whole way of thinking the whole Paradigm of ship coming back to this model of consciousness if life is structured in such a way that lived this level if we can ask what can human beings do and beans through a wall I left an envelope for the number on the other day I didn't go this would be a good test right I'd like to see a demo if you can right how many people have are these real or are they not real everybody knows that you you can't split up in the air you can't see the robot nose because everybody lives find them to these levels he said that was a level where anything could be done by sound Vibrations of energy consciousness m5000 Slim from the years ago harshita populi he has seen how these laws of nature work do those thing you can't do in computer he wrote a book how you can go by this we go to Walmart or Amazon yoga Reno tell us how to do things in yoga you can buy it and it'll say here's how to levitate here's how to do this or that that's kind of excited you can go to Walmart and get a book don't get your hopes up because it's not just superhero superpowers book yoga yoga means of unified Consciousness unified field of pure Consciousness so these describe he could do what others could do what he had seen the laws of nature I'm living life level not living it from this low that change in knowledge that movement from Kmart to k-star the vision from what was impossible normal about someone in India who could fly on the mountain or I read about the Chinese Saints who lived the top of mountain is normal call wife what's not normal is having a nervous system that can transcend the doesn't have structured itself most refined levels this description of how does this work how to be more refined level of Consciousness work this is Dan what is called March 8th in Vedic science locate star knowledge can do it we can experience improve it we can measure vedic science these three things together the Science and Technology of Consciousness yes a paradigm we have a prediction who can see what happens and it's been measured and others technology technology practice and the Advanced Techniques of the program and then later at the end of the course you probably will the word City means I think a literal translation of imperfection what would be the Perfection of action do Perfection of act well you do a lot you do a lot you don't get my results right any fish back in Action would be you get lottery results so that's the luggage levels level 2 knowledge k0k 1K star possible to have Kay Starr courses that you are right now that's why we start from that so you'll have a vision and understanding of the possibilities of what it is what is the structure nature of life like in Newton sing the whole range I'm no and Quantum Computing comes down to level of the unified field and from that it predicts these new things that learning how to manifest will be more to learn in physics there's a hole if we could design cars look at computers the computational power has increased by about 10 to the 13th the 13th a million is what 10 to the 6 billion is what time do the 9 Hotel would be for leveling be a thousand billion time that's how much Computing CPU power is in Creed 4 megabit storage has dropped by a factor of over 10000 has been I don't have a phone with me but phone has more even for whatever it is, $100 is more than a million dollar computer would have been 20 years ago what if that same why do cars people say you could buy a car for $50 the world on $1 of gas hasn't happened yet has it the more we find our Technologies are Electronics chips microprocessor is a more refined they are roast levels of buildings and stuff like that there is more refined levels our Revolution is going to be powered by these more refined levels of knowledge computer the comparison between these two things with his idea of now moving toward the idea that in fact cube it was a description of being used what that means is physics is now saying that all of this comes from information knowledge and that's the same thing that we said here the difference is there thinking about it and writing papers on writing equations learn the equations over here a couple of the pictures but I don't think it's worth the trouble to get the computer guy. Maybe I'll say one last thing about Quantum Computing because I think it's interesting and relevant Quantum Computing it's really really really hard why it's hard because these relationships between two bits big particles but they don't need to be particles very very delicate and if I do anything to disturb one or the other of it ruins a relationship at very low temperatures that's almost absolute zero on the Kelvin scale 75 degrees minus C see a picture of a quantum computer food laboratory in the chip itself is only this big so why do you need a room full of equipment you need a whole room of equipment to cool it down to almost absolute zero so you don't disturb that relationship between each other any noise Adams moving around peter's haven't even figured out very well how to do them yet of course the room temperature if you're interested you can go online and you can run Quantum computation d-wave has a cloud-based server of their Quantum Computing system microsoft has a new quanta a new Quantum Computing language called to Sharp C sharp F sharp to Sharp programs in the latest last month's issue of Microsoft tech turn on they have an article about how to write a quantum computer program using their IDE and then you can upload it and you can run it on this accessible a million dollars just to run for a few seconds how many long is there but it's something that will have to learn how to change how we do things so it is moving in this direction we need to move in our direction also and if it's very hard for them to the delicacy is that information link between two things information 01 information right it Information Technology what's the word mean in the structure there mathematically derive and shut and anything can you destroy that function even thermal noise going to experience this and we know that the Power Of Consciousness only comes from or the ultimate power that comes from that most refined quiet level only going to be powerful when we're sitting at their eyes closed and meditation when we get up to go and we don't need to be always meditating always in that silence because as we meditate remember our eyes getting used to the darkness and be able to perceive things to maintain that Silence of all time must have had that experience get meditated for a few weeks or months and then you stop meditating and you're just sitting there and you're not meditating anymore still feel she still feel that Silence with you disappears are you buying that this during the day or sitting quietly in still with you what would happen what's the linear projection of that set at all times day night the inner silence figure wakefulness is with you so that what happened with us the weekend we have a system somehow this structure coherence as we practice that's why I look at all this huge machinery for cryogenic absolute zero temperatures human physiology physical systems don't seem to have coming back to the beginning my goal was just to describe a little bit about these courses your current course is your STC course how it relates a little bit to physics and computer science and kind of things will be studied I guess what we would find it in physics we found that from that most refined level we know everything about everything how does gravity work light work I'd like to make everything is in that feel everything is in that feeling everything and compliment if we are able to and I will love when I called K Starr have knowledge of be able to understand anything principals in this course he'll study wish you would see anywhere in computer science a week we could take some exercise and do them but someone I mention already with self-referral right now that field of meditating is a self-referral field in computer science where do we see that quality of self-referral perhaps in computer science can you think of examples of that so that'll be a homework assignment that's what I like to do is take about 10 minutes and have a short group exercise so we can take if we wanted to have a stretch break and then take a 10-minute exercise take 10 minutes to review it together okay so his question was has anyone experienced has anyone experienced Kay Starr my tastes are there and if so can they fly I think is next question is can he see it somewhere what time can you go for a demonstration turn to that is there are many people who are on that path to experience that most refined level of consciousness quite answered yet there on that path what is that path while we are monks and none monks and nuns and and do no Saints in different countries and they've all they spend their life tV in that direction with whatever techniques they have and in this community that we have a whole group is called finish their professional everyday to have more experience and their experiences do show which are defined in the historical literature of higher states of consciousness completely enlightened and can they fly yet not that I know of all She Wrote This Book of yoga sutras so offensively and in the bookstore there's a book written by our vice president Craig Pearson called you'll get your flying record throughout history in different cultures of people St Francis Assisi in the Catholic tradition who said you know when he would be deep in prayer or meditation that that he would float up no one took a picture of it and unfortunately it didn't have cell phones night night so there been records of it today I don't personally know anyone who can do it but I don't know everybody professor cans does it talk about this morning of a lecture on the line well there's a quote go to speak no not in those who know or speak not so any other questions before we take a short break juan Gabriel pressure in the back do we covered a lot of different things here trying to get everything into a short. Of time thank you for the the best thing about this course is but the thing is between this I bring my mind and I really appreciate in witness this extra extra for the understanding but this time connecting consciousness daily shift in Consciousness and string so I can get the handle on modern physics and consciousness connect those more and the answer is no expert in string theory remember our brain through his call them Theory butt. Missouri study and he has a lot of very interesting and all possibilities so I think you'll get that asked him that if you're not satisfied with the end any other comments or questions before we take a shower my name is Big Ang from Mongolia I would I would like to just my opinion yeah first of all I don't think we we can find then is for me is just understand and realizing we don't need to understand anything it's just like 1 billion equal. Write 0 is equal to your right could be hectic understand but did you have a cough syrup with resentment you don't have to understand anything of course we can increase our creativity and intelligent evergreen trees beaches in fiber I don't read it and he doesn't think we need to really understand all of this is right he's absolutely right and I'm number one it doesn't really matter whether you think we can fly or not or whether you want to fly or whether you listen to read this patanjali Sandy list all kind of amazing things that you might see on TV that we can't do that but but it's it all has completely this is model of one Paradigm and then another Paradigm another paradigm yeah and it is true I mean if someone says Que if someone says their experience is and they are living this and they're just living this life is argue with them that's what their life is you need some enlightened Saint sitting on a Mountaintop in a cave or the captain and where they live is unbounded the nature of Life Is Bliss evil again christianity says the Kingdom of Heaven is within god is good in every man every religion expressions are there man is in the image of God God bless these expressions of unboundedness and the potential of humanity to live unboundedness describe live match today going to have this knowledge as I said before about someone that 5,000 years ago believe it or not the matter at all it doesn't matter I've given this example and in some other and if you look at what happens when you sleep you sleep everything Changes in your body and blood chemistry the electrical conductivity of your nerves doctor consumption the way your brain processes thing the flow of chemicals through the brain Changes Everything Changes I don't believe that are you going to sleep still works for you you don't know that you don't know what you don't do it you don't sit down and say okay and I'm trying to go to sleep and get a change my frontal out for them to 2.4 cycles per second okay good good lowering oxygen consumption one 3% activity of blood flow through the brain to flush out the alkaloids got it and like a spaceship it's built we don't even we may not know we may not believe it doesn't matter it's just that is built into the system if you think you can fly or not just you practice TM regularly you take care of yourself Pure Life of eating good things of sleeping taken care of this spaceship that's all you need to do if you don't believe that's okay that's fine joy. About it I said I don't do you think I didn't say I don't believe that Consciousness I said like I don't bleed if like
