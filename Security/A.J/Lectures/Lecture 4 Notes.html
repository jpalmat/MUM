<pre><h3>Lecture 4</h3>
This lecture is based on Chapter 6.

<h4>Executive Summary</h4>

1. Integrity security policies deal with things like separation of duty, separation of 
function and auditting. These are meant to minimize errors that would violate the integrity
of the system, not its confidentiality.

2. The Biba integrity model is the dual of the Bell-LaPadula model. In Biba, subjects and
objects are assigned integrity levels and there is no write up or read down which is the
opposite of Bell-LaPadula.

3. The Clark-Wilson integrity model is based on transactions, separation of duty and auditing.
It does not use labels like Bell-LaPadula and Biba.

4. The Clark-Wilson model introduces the 5 certification rules and 4 enforcement rules.
Certifiers are different from developers (separation of duty).

<h4>Integrity Policies</h4>

In an inventory control system integrity rather than confidentiality is the key concern.

<h4>Goals</h4>

Five requirements of an integrity policy
1. Users will not write their own program, but will use existing production programs and
databases.

2. Programmers will develop and test programs on a nonproduction system; if they need
access to actual data, they will be given production data via a special process, but
will use it on their development system.

3. A special process must be followed to install a program from the development system
onto the production system.

4. The special process in requirement 3 must be controlled and auditted.

5. The managers and auditors must have access to both system state and the
system logs that are generated.

Three principles derivable from these requirements

1. Separation of duty - if two or more steps are required to perform a critical function,
at least two different people should perform the steps.

Example - moving a program from development environment to production environment.
Step 1. Programmer writes program and tests it.
Step 2. Deployer tests program before deploying it.

Example - approving a money order
The teller and the bank manager must approve it

2. Separation of function - machines have different functions
Examples
a. Developers do not develop new programs on production systems because of the potential
threat to production data

b. Developers do not process production data on the development system.

c. The developers and testers may receive sanitized production data

d. Although distinct systems, the development and production systems must be as similar as 
possible.

3. Auditing
Auditing is the process of analyzing systems to determine what actions took place and who
performed them. Logging is the basis of auditing.

Auditing allows a company to keep track of who did what to which system.

<h4>Biba Integrity Model</h4>
In Biba's model a system consists of
a set S of subjects
a set O of objects
a set I of integrity levels

subjects and objects are assigned an integrity level.

For processes (subjects), the higher the integrity level, the more confidence one has that the 
process will execute correctly.

For data (objects), the higher the integrity level, the more accurate the data is.

A process at a higher level than an object is considered to be more trustworthy than the
object.

Biba's model is the dual of the Bell-LaPadula model (concepts from Biba can be mapped 1-1
to concepts from Bell-LaPadula)
1. A subject s can read an object o if and only if i(s)&lt;=i(o)
<i>Bell-LaPadula: S can read O if and only if l<sub>o</sub> &lt;= l<sub>s</sub> and S has discretionary read access to O.</i>
User space can read from the kernel but kernel cannot read directly from user space

2. A subject s can write to an object o if and only if i(o)&lt;=i(s)
<i>Bell-LaPadula: S can write O if and only if l<sub>s</sub> &lt;= l<sub>o</sub>  and S has discretionary write access to O.</i>
Kernel can write directly to user space, but user space cannot write directly to the kernel

3. A subject s1 can execute a subject s2 if and only if i(s2)&lt;=i(s1) (This is like a write)
The idea here is that a trusted process needs to run in a trusted environment. If it is
run by a process that is less trusted, the environment may not be appropriate for the trusted
process to run in.

In summary
Bell-LaPadula: no write down, no read up
Biba:          no read down,  no write up

<h4>Clark-Wilson Integrity model</h4>
<!--
<b>Why not just use Bell-LaPadula?</b>
The original paper on the Clark-Wilson model is available from <a href='http://crypto.stanford.edu/~ninghui/courses/Fall03/papers/clark_wilson.pdf'>here</a>.
Commercial firms rarely grant access on the basis of "clearance" like military systems do; if
a particular user needs to know specific information, he or she will be given it. While this
can be modelled in Bell-LaPadula it requires a large number of categories and security levels,
increasing the complexity of modelling. More difficult is the issue of controlling this 
proliferation of categories and security levels, In a military environment, creation of
security levels and categories is centralized. In commercial firms, this creation would 
normally be decentralized. The former allows tight control on the number of compartments,
whereas the latter allows no such control.

However,

1. Uses well-formed transactions as the basic operation.

D + YB - W = TB
where
D is deposits made today
W is withdrawals made today
YB is yesterday's balance
TB is today's balance

A <i>well-formed transaction</i> is a series of operations that transition the system from
one consistent state to another consistent state hiding any intermediate states that may be
inconsisent.

A well-formed transaction must be certified (i.e., test/proved correct). This is an 
example of separation of duty (the certifiers and the implementors are different people)

Some acronyms used by Clark-Wilson
CDI constrained data item
UDI unconstrained data item
IVP integrity verification procedure
TP  transformation procedure (a well-formed transaction)

<b>Certification rule 1</b> (CR1) When any IVP is run, it must ensure that all CDIs are in a 
valid state

<b>Certification rule 2</b> (CR2) For some associated set of CDIs, a TP must transform those 
CDIs that are in a valid state into a (possibly different) valid state. (A TP is only certified
to work with a certain set of CDIs).

Mathematically this CR2 can be expressed as a relation named <i>certified</i>, e.g.,
certified = 
{
  &lt;TP<sub>1</sub>, CDI<sub>1</sub>&gt;
  &lt;TP<sub>1</sub>, CDI<sub>2</sub>&gt;
  &lt;TP<sub>2</sub>, CDI<sub>2</sub>&gt;
  &lt;TP<sub>2</sub>, CDI<sub>3</sub>&gt;
}
The above says that TP<sub>1</sub> is certified to manipulate CDI<sub>1</sub> and CDI<sub>2</sub> and
TP<sub>2</sub> is certified to manipulate CDI<sub>2</sub> and CDI<sub>3</sub>

<b>Enforcement rule 1</b> (ER1) The system must maintain the certified relation, and must ensure
that only TPs certified to run on a CDI manipulate that CDI.

<b>Enforcement rule 2</b> (ER2) The system must associate a user with each TP and set of CDIs. 
The TP may access those CDIs on behalf of the associated user. If the user is not associated 
with a particular TP and CDI, then the TP cannot access that CDI on behalf of that user.

The information needed by ER2 can be represented in the <i>allowed</i> relation as follows:
allowed = 
{
  &lt;user, TP, {CDIs}&gt;
  &lt;user, TP, {CDIs}&gt;
  &lt;user, TP, {CDIs}&gt;
...
}

This prevents a janitor from running a TP that makes a deposit.

<b>Certification Rule 3</b> (CR3) The <i>allowed</i> relation must meet the requirements
imposed by the principle of separation of duty.

<b>Enforcement rule 3</b> (ER3) The system must authenticate each user attempting to execute a 
TP.

<b>Certification rule 4</b> (CR4) All TPs must append, to an append-only CD, enough information 
to reconstruct the operation.

The log is a CDI that no TP can overwrite.

<b>Certification rule 5</b> (CR5) Any TP that takes as input a UDI may perform only valid
transformations or no transformations, for all possible values of the UDI. The transformation
either rejects the UDI or transforms it into a CDI

All UDIs are evil.

<b>Enforcement rule</b> (ER4) Only the certifier of a TP may change the list of entities
associated with that TP. No certifier of a TP, or of an entity associated with that TP,
may ever have execute permission with respect to that entity.

<h4>Some examples of the use of certification and enforcement rules</h4>
<b>Task: Add a new TP and its associated CDIs to the certified relation</b>
(translation: add a new program and the tables it may access to a configuration file)
To achieve this, the following certification rules must be verified:

1. CR1: Verify that any IVPs that validate action of new TP work properly

2. CR2: Verify that TP transform CDIs from a valid state to a valid state.

3. CR4: Verify that the TP appends enough information to reconstruct the operation to
a log file (called an append-only CDI)

4. CR5: If the TP takes a UDI, make sure it transforms it into a CDI before using it.

<b>Task: Add a user to the allowed relation</b>
(translation: give a user permission to run a program)
To achieve this, the following certification rule must be verified:

CR3: Verify that the user is not already associated with a TP that
violates the principle of separation of duty. If not, the add user and TP to the
allowed relation.

<b>Task: A user wants to run a TP on a CDI</b>
To achieve this, the following enforcement rules must be carried out

ER1: Verify that TP is associated with the CDI in the certifies relation

ER2: Verify that the user who is running the TP is in the allowed relation.

ER3: Authenticate the user before letting them run the TP (principle of separation of privilege).

Finally, let user run TP on the CDI and log the transaction

<b>Task: Change list of CDIs associated with a TP</b>
To achieve this, the following enforcement rule must be carried out:

ER4: Only person responsible for the certified relation can do this
and that person must not be a user of the TP.


The Clark-Wilson model contributed two new ideas to integrity models

1. It captured the way that most commercial firms work with data. They enforce separation of
duty and do not classify data using a multilevel scheme.

2. The notion of certification is distinct from that of enforcement and each has its own
set of rules.

How are Lipner's goals satisfied:
1.User's don't write programs but use existing programs.

<i>Assuming that users are not allowed to perform certifications of TPs, then CR2 and ER4 enforce 
this requirement. Any CDI can only be modified by a certified TP.</i>

2.Developers don't use production system for development and testing

<i>This requirement is largely procedural. Can be enforced by removing compilers from 
production system and using a TP to sanitize or generate production data.</i>

3. Installing a program on the production system is a special process (not done by a
developer)

<i>Use a TP to do the installation; only trusted personel are authorized to run the TP.</i>

4. The special process in 3 must be controlled and audited

<i>CR4 (auditing), ER3 (authenticating) assures that only trusted personel do this. New
version is a UDI until it is validated by TP.</i>

5. Managers and auditors must have access to logs.

<i>A log is a CDI, management and auditors can be allowed access to it via a TP.</i>

<h4>Clark-Wilson assessment</h4>
Too static 

Too centralized: security-officer is God and nobody else can change any authorization 

Has had a beneficial effect in convincing the mainstream security community that there is more 
to integrity than Biba 
 
<h4>Comparison of Clark-Wilson with Biba</h4>

Clark-Wilson attaches two security levels to subjects (certified and not certified) 
and two security levels to objects (CDI and UDI)

Biba does not have certification rules

Biba requires security officer to approve each elevation of a UDI to a CDI. Clark-Wilson 
just requires the security officer to certify the method that converts a UDI to a CDI. This
is more practical.
